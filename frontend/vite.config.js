// By doing this, Vite acts as an intermediary.
// In fact, Axios sends its request to http://localhost:5173/api/products,
// but the Vite server forwards the request to http://localhost:5000/api/products.

// In certain circumstances, when the /api/wahtever... path is not available,
// the Vite server By default, for undefined paths,redirect the request to the original index.html file and return it as a successful response (with code 200).

// This proxy ensures that any request starting with '/api' is correctly
// routed to the backend and does not fall back to the default behavior.

// when the internet is down, the request does not reach the back-end server and a real network error occurs, which Axios can catch and the error in Zustand is updated correctly.
